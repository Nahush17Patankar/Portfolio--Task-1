               <h2>My Strengths</h2>
               <p>
                
                Every leader has shortcomings, from the CEO down to the frontline supervisor. Reasonably enough, executive development programs often focus on reducing these deficits, whether the weakness is in public speaking, time management, or people skills. But sometimes it’s a leader’s strengths that are the problem.
                
                Take one brilliant and well-respected media executive that my colleagues and I interviewed. Though his peers and his staff acknowledged his intellect in a variety of ways, he remained steadfast in his belief that he wasn’t exceptional. “I don’t think of myself as unusually smart,” he told us. “I do have a good-enough understanding about things most of the time, but that’s not brilliance.” The problem that arose from this misjudgment was that he could be abrasively impatient. When a staff member asked him to repeat a point in a complex presentation, for example, he chided her for not keeping up, noting that if he got it right away, she should. This destructive behavior intimidated his staff and deprived him of their full contributions.
                
                Underrating oneself, as this executive did, gives rise to two common distortions in managerial behavior: overdoing and underdoing. In this case, the media executive overdid it by aggressively asserting his intelligence. Another executive that we consulted with was worried that he lacked authority—even though he was a naturally commanding person—and so he poured it on and was perceived by his staff as overpowering.</p>
                <h2>My Weakness to overcome</h2>
                <p>One my true weakness is self doubt which shakes my confidence and let to overcome in my personal aura.It isn't easy to face the challenge of recognizing and overcoming your weaknesses. But it is important to do in order to cultivate success in your career. If you want to overcome your personal and professional weaknesses and develop your competencies, it's crucial to understand how to start the process.
                    Improved productivity: Overcoming your weakness can help you boost your productivity at work. For example, if you struggle with time management, working purposefully toward using your time more efficiently can allow you to achieve more throughout your workday than otherwise.
                    Skills diversification: It's common for professionals to have weaknesses in particular skill areas, but targeting these deficits specifically can help you diversify your skills overall. For instance, if you face challenges with public speaking, overcoming this can help you offer a higher level of competency in your role.
                    Potential for advancement: Sometimes, having certain weaknesses—like poor leadership skills or inefficient time management—can hold you back from advancing in your career even if you have strengths in other areas. Overcoming such weaknesses can help you increase your potential for advancement through promotions and raises.
                    Increased confidence: In many fields, having professional confidence is key to success. Mastering your weakness, improving your productivity and becoming stronger in specific competency areas can help you increase your self-assurance and confidence in your performance.

                <h2>Future belief</h2>
                <p>Across cultures, schooling is a future-oriented investment. Studies of minority students' school achievement have advanced future goals as a crucial protective factor in the face of frequent school failure. At the same time, cultural discontinuities and limited opportunities in minority students' school careers may weaken the motivational force of the future. Our review of the seemingly contradictory evidence on the role of the future in minority students' school achievement calls for a more fine-grained motivational theory of the future. Specifically, converging findings support conceptual distinctions (a) between positive and negative perceptions of the instrumentality of school tasks for future goals, and (b) between internal and external regulation of classroom behaviour by future goals. </p>
